- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @chamonixvon
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in java, Roman history and, most favorite, football. I'm a Bayern fan from 2016, having witnessed the depressed period of the team, and FORTUNATELY seen the squad winning the UCL last year.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java and trying to learn some application by myself
